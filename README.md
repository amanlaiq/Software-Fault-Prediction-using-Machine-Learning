# Software-Fault-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A software fault prediction model developed using machine learning algorithms. 
This model is developed using  algorithms like random forest and support vector that predicts faults of a software 
#Motivation
This project is contributed as a final year minor project during undergraduation at JNTUH. The main aim improve testing 
duration, Resources, infrastructure costs and project risks by predicting faults of a software.
